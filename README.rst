Taarifa Waterpoints
===================

Background
__________

Taarifa_ is an open source platform for the crowd sourced reporting and
triaging of infrastructure related issues. Think of it as a bug tracker
for the real world which helps to engage citizens with their local
government.

The Taarifa platform is built around the `Taarifa API`_, a RESTful
service offering that clients can interact with to create and triage
'bugreports' relating to public infrastructure (e.g., the public toilet
is broken).


Waterpoints
___________

This repository contains an example application around Waterpoint
Management built on top of the core API.  It contains scripts to import
Waterpoint data (resources) which then become available through the API
to file requests against (e.g., waterpoint 2345 is broken and needs
fixing).

There is also an angularjs_ web application that illustrates how a user
can interact with the API and data through a browser.


Installation
____________

.. note::
  You may choose to install into a virtual machine as described further down.

Requires Python, pip and the `Taarifa API`_ to be installed and MongoDB to
be running.

To ease development and debugging we suggest you use virtualenv_. 
Install virtualenv_ and virtualenvwrapper (you might need `sudo` for this): ::

  pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper

`Set up virtualenvwrapper`_ according to your shell and create a virtualenv: ::

  mkvirtualenv TaarifaAPI

If you already created the virtualenv for the `Taarifa API`_, activate it: ::

  workon TaarifaAPI

Clone the repository ::

  git clone https://github.com/taarifa/TaarifaWaterpoints

Change into directory and install the requirements ::
  
  cd TaarifaWaterpoints
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you have node.js and npm installed. Then, from the
`TaarifaWaterpoints` directory, install the dependencies: ::

  npm install

Install the Grunt_ command line interface (may require `sudo`): ::

  npm install -g grunt-cli

Continue with the usage section.

Installation using a virtual machine
____________________________________

Instead of following the installation instructions above you may choose to
set up a virtual machine with all dependencies installed. This process is fully
automated using Vagrant_ and the provided Vagrantfile_. Note that the
Vagrantfile is included in the repository and needs not be downloaded.

Install VirtualBox_ and Vagrant_ for your platform.

Clone the repositories into the same root folder. This is required since these
local folders are mounted in the VM such that you can edit files either on the
host or in the VM. ::

  git clone https://github.com/taarifa/TaarifaAPI
  git clone https://github.com/taarifa/TaarifaWaterpoints
  cd TaarifaWaterpoints

Start the VM. This may take quite a while the very first time as the VM image
needs to be downloaded (~360MB) and the VM provisioned with all dependencies.
On every subsequent use these steps are skipped. ::

  vagrant up

In case provisioning fails due to e.g. loss of network connection, run the
provisioning scripts again until successful: ::

  vagrant provision

MacOS X note: you may find that the vagrant VM doesn't come up, failing because
"pip" and "npm" are not present on the MacOS host. In that case, pip can be downloaded
and installed using the following:
  sudo easy_install pip
npm is the package manager for Node.js, and can be installed with Node.js. Packaged
installers for MacOS and other platforms are available here:
  http://nodejs.org/download/

Connect to the virtual machine and change into the `TaarifaWaterpoints`
folder: ::

  vagrant ssh
  cd TaarifaWaterpoints

You can then continue with the usage section below. The ports are automatically
forwarded so you can access the API and frontend from your host browser. Note
that both the `TaarifaAPI` and the `TaarifaWaterpoints` folders in the VM are
mounted from the host i.e. changes made on the host are immediately reflected in
the VM and vice versa. This allows you to work on the code either on the host or
in the VM according to your preference.


Usage
_____

Make sure the virtualenv is active: ::

  workon TaarifaAPI

From the TaarifaWaterpoints directory run the following commands to
create the waterpoint schemas: ::

  python manage.py create_facility
  python manage.py create_service
  
Then upload the waterpoint data: ::

  python manage.py upload_waterpoints <path-to-waterpoints-csv.gz>

Start the application from the TaarifaWaterpoints directory by running: ::

  python manage.py runserver -r -d

By default the API server is only accessible from the local machine. If access
from the outside is required (e.g. when running from inside a VM), run: ::

  python manage.py runserver -h 0.0.0.0 -r -d

The flags ``-r`` and ``-d`` cause the server to run in debug mode and reload
automatically when files are changed.

To check things are working, open a browser and navigate to: ::

  http://localhost:5000/api/waterpoints

This should show a list of all the waterpoint resources currently in the
database.

To use the web application simply start the server using grunt: ::

  grunt serve --watch

Then navigate to: ::

  http://localhost:9000
